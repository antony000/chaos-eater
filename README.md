## Introduction

Welcome to the "ChaosEater" repository! This repository contains the code for "ChaosEater: Fully Automating Chaos Engineering with Large Language Models". ChaosEater is a cutting-edge tool that leverages large language models to automate chaos engineering in software systems.

Chaos engineering is a discipline aimed at improving system resilience by proactively injecting failures into a system to uncover hidden issues. With ChaosEater, this process is fully automated, thanks to the power of large language models like GPT-3 and others.

---

## Features

- Fully automate chaos engineering experiments in your software system.
- Seamless integration with popular chaos engineering tools like Chaos Mesh, k6, and Kubernetes.
- Utilize large language models for intelligent decision-making during chaos experiments.
- Support for microservices architectures and complex software systems.
- Enhance the overall resilience of your software through automated chaos testing.
